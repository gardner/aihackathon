> Reconciled demand and generation data is our most complete source of data and refers to all purchases and sales on the wholesale market that are cleared through the clearing manager. This data is currently reconciled up to 30/06/2023, with updates becoming available around the middle of the following month. More specifically, reconciled demand and generation refers to loss-adjusted purchases and sales, and represents the purchase and sale quantities upon which money changes hands between participants and the clearing manager. The loss-adjustment means that the actual consumption data submitted to the reconciliation manager by retailers and other purchasers is grossed up to account for losses in the distribution networks.
